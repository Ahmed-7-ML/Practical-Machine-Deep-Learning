# 🧠 Machine Learning

This section of the repository covers comprehensive **theoretical explanations** and **hands-on coding implementations** of key Machine Learning algorithms and concepts. The folder is divided into:

- **Supervised Learning** 📊 (Regression & Classification)
- **Unsupervised Learning** 🧩 (Clustering & Dimensionality Reduction)
- **Reinforcement Learning** 🎮 (Agents that learn by interacting with environments)

## 📘 Content Overview

### 1. Supervised Learning 📊

Algorithms trained with labeled data.

- **Regression**: Predict continuous values (e.g., Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression).
- **Classification**: Predict class labels (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees).
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models to improve accuracy (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).

### 2. Unsupervised Learning 🧩

Algorithms that discover patterns in unlabeled data.

- **Clustering**: Group similar data points (K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical).
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduce features while retaining important information (PCA, t-SNE).

### 3. Reinforcement Learning 🎮

Training an **Agent** to interact with an **Environment** by maximizing rewards.

- Value-based Methods: Q-Learning, SARSA.
- Policy-based Methods: Policy Gradient.
- Deep RL: Deep Q Networks (DQN).

## 🧪 Practical Workflow in Each Algorithm

Each algorithm folder typically contains:

1. `Theory.pptx`: Conceptual understanding with visuals & formulas.
2. `Code.ipynb`: Step-by-step coding implementation.
3. `data/`: Sample datasets for experimentation.
4. `README.md`: Brief explanation of the algorithm’s objective and key points.
