# üöÄ End-To-End Machine & Deep Learning Projects

This section contains **real-world projects** that demonstrate the **entire Machine Learning Lifecycle**, starting from **Problem Understanding ‚Üí Data Preprocessing ‚Üí Model Building ‚Üí Evaluation ‚Üí Deployment**.

Each project follows a structured approach and includes:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Building & Tuning
- Deployment (Streamlit / Flask / Docker)
- Documentation & Visualizations

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Workflow (Lifecycle)

Every project follows these main steps:

1. **Problem Definition**  
   Understand the business problem and define project goals.
2. **Data Collection & Cleaning**  
   Acquire datasets, handle missing values, outliers, etc.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Data visualization and statistical summaries to understand patterns.
4. **Feature Engineering**  
   Create or select meaningful features to improve model performance.
5. **Model Building**  
   Choose the right algorithm, train the model, evaluate performance.
6. **Model Evaluation & Metrics**  
   Analyze accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC, confusion matrix, etc.
7. **Hyperparameter Tuning**  
   Use GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV, or manual tuning for best results.
8. **Deployment**  
   Build simple web apps (Streamlit / Flask) or APIs for model deployment.
9. **Documentation & Reporting**  
   Document all steps and visualizations.
